Overview
CustomPrint is a lightweight C/C++ function that allows you to parse a format string and print characters and integers to the standard output, similar to the standard printf function. It provides a simple and customizable way to format and display data in your console applications.

CustomPrint supports the following format specifiers:

%c: Print a single character.
%s: Print a null-terminated string.
%d: Print an integer.
